This is one of my first Java projects. 

A data access layer loads a csv file as an ArrayList of Hashmaps, once the data is loaded users can make requests via the console 
to return search results. 

Once the console application has received user choices, it either prints out a list of the data, or takes further data in the form of 
a category and search term. Results are printed to the console.
